Have you ever been to the screamroom? It melds... your mind

I just came up with an idea...
I can use README as a todo list! So...
I've decided to divide it into categories, cause there is a lot of stuff to do

THE GAME IS ALMOST FINISHED... I just have to fix buggs + make some minor changes

# TODO:
## Items:
* Revert the rifle to original state as it is currently overpowered (for testing issues only)

## Dungeon:
* Fix a bug that allows spawning enemies while the player is between two spikes resulting in player getting stuck
* Fix a bug that allows activating spike colliders despite clearing the room (invoking enemy destruction multiple times?)

## Other:
* Add sounds to particular actions
* Add background music (optional)
