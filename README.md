Have you ever been to the screamroom? It melds... your mind

I just came up with an idea...
I can use README as a todo list! So...
I've decided to divide it into categories, cause there is a lot of stuff to do

# TODO:
## Player:
* Loosing health
* Spawning player

## Items:
* Implement item spawning (Probably random, maybe in chests)

## Dungeon:
* Implement colliders inside the dungeon
* Implement spikes + player whereabouts detection
* Implement hiding rooms unvisited by the player
* Implement player spawning and level finishing

## Enemies:
* Add enemy class
* Add enemy interacting with the pllayer (for example shooting)
* Use UnityAI to move enemies around the rooms (no idea how to do that)
* Implement spawning enemies

## Other:
* Add sounds to particular actions + collect the remaining sounds
* Implement game menu
* Add background music (optional)
* Add shadows to enemies
