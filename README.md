# Usage

The final version of the game is an .exe file named FearOfTheDuck placed in Builds directory. It should work on Windows operating system. 
Sometimes the crosshair might not appear - in that case you have to restart the game. As there is no implementation of exit button,
you have to stop the process manually (alt + F4 should be enough to leave).
