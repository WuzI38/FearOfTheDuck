Have you ever been to the screamroom? It melds... your mind

I just came up with an idea...
I can use README as a todo list! So...
I've decided to divide it into categories, cause there is a lot of stuff to do

# TODO:
## Player:
Finish item list implementation, enable adding and removing items
Make guns in player's hand functional
Implement getting and loosing health

## Items:
Add guns based on the gun class (Polymorphism)
Implement rotating guns, so they face crosshair's position
Implement shooting
Implement picking items + finish inventory system
Implement item spawning (Probably random, maybe in chests)

## Dungeon:
Implement colliders inside the dungeon
Implement spikes + player whereabouts detection
Implement hiding rooms unvisited by the player
Implement player spawning and level finishing

## Enemies:
Add enemy class
Add enemy interacting with the pllayer (for example shooting)
Use UnityAI to move enemies around the rooms (no idea how to do that)
Implement spawning enemies

## Other:
Finalize sound manager creation, add sounds to sound folder + add sounds to particular actions
Implement game menu
Add chest image (optional)
Add background music (optional)
Add shadows to player and enemies
