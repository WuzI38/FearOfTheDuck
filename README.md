## Full version
The playable version of the game (FearOfTheDuck.exe) is accessible in the builds directory - you need all the files in that directory for the game to work properly (resources, files generated during building process). After launching the app there might be an error occuring - the crosshair may be missing. In that case just turn the whole application off and start it over again.

## Controls
* WSAD/arrows - movement
* E - interaction/pickup
