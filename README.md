Have you ever been to the screamroom? It melds... your mind

I just came up with an idea...
I can use README as a todo list! So...
I've decided to divide it into categories, cause there is a lot of stuff to do

# TODO:
## Player:
* Spawning player

## Items:

## Dungeon:
* Implement spikes + player whereabouts detection
* Implement level finishing
* Open exit if enough enemies were killed

## Enemies:
* Implement spawning enemies
* Count dead enemies and remaining enemies

## Other:
* Add sounds to particular actions + collect the remaining sounds
* Implement game menu
* Add background music (optional)
* Add shadows to enemies
